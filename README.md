# TwitchPidginSmileyConverter
Downloads every Smiley from twitch and sets it as a custom smiley plugin for pidgin

Just edit the line: File dir = new File("/home/weini/.purple/smileys/subscriberTwitchSmileys/");
and run it.

You can run it multiple times (e.g. as a cron every day) it will just download every emote it has not stored already.
